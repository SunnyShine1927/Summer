    <h2> How Shooting Games Came To Be </h2>
        <p>First-person shooting games have been around for nearly 50 years.  The first attempt at an FPS game was in 1973 with Maze War being installed at the NASA Ames Research Center. Players could move through a 3D maze slowly, while also shooting other players who appeared as eyeballs. Then jumping to the late 90's the game Duke Nukem 3D,  was the first FPS that won acclaim for its highly interactive environments, adrenaline-filled gameplay, the way it made the protagonist a star, and the wise jokes the player made while he fought aliens. Now FPS games have become a staple subgenre of games. You can play with friends and the graphics have gotten so much better, that make you feel like you are in the game. </p>
