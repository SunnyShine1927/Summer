    <h2> What inspired me to start making stickers </h2>
        <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m the artist behind Myrias DIYs ðŸŽ¨âœ¨ Iâ€™ve been drawing ever since I was a kid â€” always doodling cute things and dreaming up little worlds filled with color and happiness. Over the years, I took art classes on and off, learning new ways to bring my imagination to life.
Eventually, I decided to take a big step â€” I left my retail job to focus on college and to start my own small business doing what I love most: creating art that makes people smile. ðŸ’–
Every sticker, keychain, shirt, bag, and bookmark I design comes straight from the heart. My goal is simple â€” to bring a little bit of joy and comfort back into peopleâ€™s lives through cute, meaningful art. ðŸŒˆâœ¨ </p>
