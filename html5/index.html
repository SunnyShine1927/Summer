<h3>Beginning of Video Games </h3>
<p> The start of video games all happened because of some research scientists in a lab. In 1952, British professor A.S. Douglas created OXO, also known as noughts and crosses or a tic-tac-toe. Then Tennis for Two on a large analog computer was created in 1958, by William Higinbotham. The most popular game back then though, came out in In 1962. Steve Russell invented Spacewar and it was a computer-based space combat video game for the PDP-1. People loved it because it could be played on multiple computer installations for the first time. Once 1985 hit the video game console called "The Nintendo Entertainment System" and made amazing sales. People loved playing the game Super Mario Bros on it and is one of the highest-selling video game consoles yet offered.</p>
